# clean-helper

Older school project that estimates theoretical cleaning times of an office building. Documentation and program in Finnish as per the assignment given to me.

User inputs the amounts of various areas of the building as well as their sizes and levels of dirtiness. Finally, the program prints out an estimate of how long it will take to clean the building as well as the amount of cleaners needed for the job. The information is printed on the screen and also into a text file.
